            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Forth Dimension is a locally based amateur dramatic musical society in South Queensferry. We are open to adults and children 9 years of age or over, who wish to sing and act on stage - working together, but having fun in the process. We put on a pantomime at the end of each year and an additional all singing concert or cabaret in the spring. The pantomime requires a strong sense of commitment as it runs for a week whereas the concert is for 2 nights and is used to help raise funds towards the putting on of the pantomime.</p>
